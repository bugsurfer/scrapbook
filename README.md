# ```gh-pages``` branch

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is an awesome feature of GitHub which allows you to host static websites whose code is hosted in a GitHub repository.

### Try it out!
To try GitHub pages. Prepare a HTML page which talks about yourself! It need not be dandy, keep it simple. Name your HTML file with your username, eg., my username is ```crimsoncowl```, so my HTML file would be ```crimsoncowl.html```. Add this HTML file to this ```gh-pages``` branch by creating proper pull request and see your page live at - ```crimsoncowl.github.io/scrapbook/you-username.html```. For example, checkout [this page](https://crimsoncowl.github.io/scrapbook/VamsiSangam.html).

Happy Coding!
